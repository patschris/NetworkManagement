# Network Management
Data management program using [FCAPS](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/FCAPS) model.<br/>
[Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/gr/), [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), [Wireless NetView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_network_view.html) and [Xirrus Wifi Inspector](https://www.riverbed.com/gb/products/xirrus/inspector.html) used in order to collect network's data.<br/>
We used a database to store the data from these four sources. We have a GUI for inserting data in *XML* or *CSV* format and a GUI with the common network problems based on *FCAPS*.
<br/> Database with data available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zlhelu11avzck4g/AACVxSAYUd18w54BwXCHieqAa?dl=0)
